# Scripts
In this repository I will store various scripts that I made for my Linux install.

# Script list
The scripts that I made are:
* [Take screenshot](../main/screenshot) - a very simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for taking screenshots with PrintScreen key.
* [Save screenshot to clipboard](../main/screenshot_clipboard) - a simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for copying selected portion of screen to clipboard.
* [Paste to clipboard](../main/paste_clipboard) - a simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for pasting contents of a clipboard to a predefined folder.
* [Locker menu](../main/locker_menu) - a script to lock, suspend or hibernate a screen and reboot or shutdown a computer.
* [Locker](../main/locker) - same as ***[Locker menu](../main/locker_menu)*** script, just with some command line flags added.
