# Scripts
In this repository I will store various scripts that I made for my Linux install.

# Script list
The scripts that I made are:
* [screenshot](../main/screenshot) - a very simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for taking screenshots with PrintScreen key.
* [screenshot clipboard](../main/screenshot_clipboard) - a simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for copying selected portion of screen to clipboard.
* [paste clipboard](../main/paste_clipboard) - a simple script, taken from my i3wm config, for pasting contents of a clipboard to a predefined folder.
